Show me a random sample of 5 rows the dataframe. 

What is the maximum in sepal width?

What is the mean petal width for each of the species?

What is the median sepal width for setosa?

What is the mean and standard deviation sepal length for each of the three species?

What is the dot product between columns sepal width and petal length?

Train a logistic regression model on all of the samples of df. The input columns are sepal length and sepal width the output column is species. Report the training accuracy.

"Test here code copying by modifying train to test acc"

Plot a histogram of sepal width.

Plot a scatterplot between sepal length and petal length. Hightlight the species.

Plot the first two principle components. Ignore the column Id and Species. Hightlight the species

Train a logistic regression, kNN, svm and a multilayer perceptron. The input columns are sepal length, petal length and sepal width and the output column is species. Report the model with the highest 10-fold cross validation accuracy.


### Demo

Do you need any information on the column names? Are they self-explanatory?

What is the mean and standard deviation sepal length for each species? Which species has the largest dimensions?

Plot a scatterplot between sepal length and petal length. Hightlight the species.

Plot the first two principle components. Ignore the column Id and Species. Color the species

Train a logistic regression, kNN, svm and a multilayer perceptron. The input columns are sepal length, petal length and sepal width and the output column is species. Report the model with the highest 10-fold cross validation accuracy.


## titanic prompts

### Demo

Here is some more information for you.
survival: Survival (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
pclass: Ticket class	(1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
sex: Sex	
Age: Age in years	
sibsp:	# of siblings / spouses aboard the Titanic	
parch:	# of parents / children aboard the Titanic	
ticket:	Ticket number	
fare:	Passenger fare	
cabin:	Cabin number	
embarke:d	Port of Embarkation

How many rows are there?

How many passengers survived?

Which gender had a better survival rate?

Did the cost of ticket made any difference to one's survival?

Did persons travelling with others had better survival than those travelling alone?

Did children below 18 and elders above 60 had a better chance of survival than others?

Please provide a 2x2 grid plot of survived vs age, fare, sex and pclass. Use histograms for age and fare, and barplots with survival percentages for sex and pclass.
