:exclamation: _The README.md content has been fully deleted in the patch._

It seems the entire content of the README.md file was removed in the provided patch. If this was intentional and you're creating a placeholder or intend to rewrite the document entirely, further actions may be necessary to update the content accordingly. If this was accidental, restoring the content from a previous version might be needed.

However, since the file is completely empty now based on the patch, no specific updates reflecting code changes can be made.
