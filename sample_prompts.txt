Show me a random sample of the dataframe. Use pretty table.

What is the maximum in sepal width?

What is the mean petal width for each of the species?

What is the median sepal width for setosa?

What is the mean and standard deviation sepal length?

What is the dot product between columns sepal width and petal length?

Train a logistic regression model on all of the samples of df. The input columns are sepal length and sepal width the output column is species. Report the training accuracy.

Plot a histogram of sepal width.

Plot a scatterplot between sepal length and petal length.

Plot the first two principle components. Ignore the column Id and Species.

Train a svm on all of the samples of df. The input columns are sepal length, petal length and sepal width the output column is species. Report the 10-fold cross validation accuracy.
