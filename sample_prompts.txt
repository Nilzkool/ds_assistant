I want to develop a simple chatbot application using Streamlit that
1. Lets user enter a python statement as a prompt
2. The application uses an ipython server to execute the prompt
3. The user receives an response
4. The history of the conversation has to be available to the user to see

This is such a weird code. The user should not have to define how many prompt she will make in the beginning. I want to develop a chatgpt like interface where the user enters a prompt and receives a response. The history of the conversation has to be available to the user to see.


Assuming that the dataset has been split into training and testing sets, and the logistic regression model has been trained on the training set, the following code can be used to calculate the training loss:

x=5

What is the maximum in sepal width?


What is the dot product between columns sepal width and petal length?

Train a logistic regression model on all of the samples of df. The input columns are sepal length and sepal width the output column is species. Report the training accuracy.

Plot a histogram of sepal width.
